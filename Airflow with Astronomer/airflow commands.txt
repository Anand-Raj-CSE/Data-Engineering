1. Initializing the project :
    astro dev init
2. to run everything on docker :
    astro dev start
    It will start running airflow on local host: 8080
    The login credentials are admin , admin all in username and passwordboth bu default.
    For initial part it would take time as it would install airflow solely on machine and then 
    initialize a docker container for it to run over.

3. When airflow is up and running then we go to DAGs , by default there is one DAG created as there is 
already a exampledag.py file in dags that will run automatically. There we could see all the functions 
being called and we can schedule as well from there.

4. Finallly to stop the airflow and the docker container we can use :
    astro dev stop
    It would delete all the instances and will abandon all the docker container.
